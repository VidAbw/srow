This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## CI/CD with GitHub Actions

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The workflow automatically builds, tests, and deploys your application when you push to the main branch.

### Setting up GitHub Actions

1. **Add the required secrets to your GitHub repository**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository
   - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions"

     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`
     - `FIREBASE_TOKEN` (Get this by running `firebase login:ci` locally)

2. **Push your code to GitHub**:
   Your application will automatically be built, tested, and deployed when you push to the main branch.
